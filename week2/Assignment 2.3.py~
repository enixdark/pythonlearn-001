#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to #compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay #should be 96.25). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the #string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
#
#Output:
#
#96.25
#
# The code below almost works

name = raw_input("Enter your name")
print "Hello %s" % name
